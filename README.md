COMP 20 Fall 2016


I. Purpose of this Git repository

The purpose of this Git repository is to showcase the projects created for
Tufts COMP 20: Web Programming.


II. Favorite lab or assignment

My favorite lab was Lab 5: Closed Captioning because I found the
subject interesting and the process wwas very involved. I think closed
captioning is very important and I liked having the opportunity to learn
about how it works and to get a feel for the useful things that computer
science can be used for. I'm also a huge fan of Gene Wilder and of
Young Frankenstein, so I had a lot of fun watching the video and creating
the subtitles.


III. Growth since day 1

Since day 1 of this course, I have grown as both a student and as a programmer.
I think that I have a better understanding of how the web works, how databases
work, and how all the tools we used in class are used in the real world.


IV. Most important lesson

The most important thing I learned in this class is that resources for learning
do not end with professors and TAs. On the first assignment (our portfolio), I
did not know how to build a sophisticated CSS file. One of the first things I
found when I googled css expamples was a resource of color and design options
and the documentation for relevant css. In the second assignmnta (the MBTA map)
I found the Google Maps API online documentation to be very helpful. It gave
examples for loading the map, changing icons, and even searching.


V. Future with web programming

Now that I have finished this course, I would like to learn more about web
engineering and security. I would love to be able to build a website on my own,
and these two topics go well together becuase privacy and security are
important to the integrity of a website.
